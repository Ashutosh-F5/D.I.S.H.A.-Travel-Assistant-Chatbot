# Chatbot for Travel and Tourism

Chatbots are programs that simulate human conversation. These can range from
simple rule-based chatbots, where the user is limited to clicking on buttons or suggested
replies that the bot provides, all the way to fully-fledged bots that can handle context,
chitchat, and other complex things, which are otherwise very common in human
conversation.The main objective of our project is to develop a chatbot which can assist
the tourists to find the tourist attractions in Maharashtra and help with the required
details of the locations,book hotels and book tickets etc.
