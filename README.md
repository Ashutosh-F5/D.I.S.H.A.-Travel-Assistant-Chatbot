# Chatbot for Travel and Tourism

Chatbots are programs that simulate human conversation. These can range from
simple rule-based chatbots, where the user is limited to clicking on buttons or suggested
replies that the bot provides, all the way to fully-fledged bots that can handle context,
chitchat, and other complex things, which are otherwise very common in human
conversation.The main objective of our project is to develop a chatbot which can assist
the tourists to find the tourist attractions in Maharashtra and help with the required
details of the locations,book hotels and book tickets etc.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML

**Server:** Python, Rasa Machine Learning Framework

## Best Configuration
We compared two different pipeline configurations: default configuration, customized configuration.In each case weâ€™re training a DIETClassifier for combined intent classification and entity recognition for 100 epochs and 500 epochs respectively, but in the default configuration we have CountVectorsFeaturizer, which creates bag-of-word representations for each incoming message at word and character levels. In the end, we decided to use default model as the ideal configuration of the chatbot.
