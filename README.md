# Chatbot for Travel and Tourism

Tourists have to spend a lot of time searching for the appropriate hotels,restaurants,and
places to visit. They face problems due to scattered data on websites and unable to find
user-friendly interfaces. The objective of our project is to develop a chatbot which can assist
the people easily and provide all the necessary details. The travel bot interacts with the
users and helps them with the required details. We have used the Rasa Open Source
Machine Learning framework to build our chatbot and integrated it with a web interface for
end users.

Chatbots are programs that simulate human conversation. These can range from
simple rule-based chatbots, where the user is limited to clicking on buttons or suggested
replies that the bot provides, all the way to fully-fledged bots that can handle context,
chitchat, and other complex things, which are otherwise very common in human
conversation.The main objective of our project is to develop a chatbot which can assist
the tourists to find the tourist attractions in Maharashtra and help with the required
details of the locations,book hotels and book tickets etc.
